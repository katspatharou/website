          We love creating production-ready software that solves real-life
          problems. We value exactness, time effeciency and user experience.<br />
          We also are an open-source first company, meaning that we open-source
          whatever can be open-sourced without exposing our clients.

          While we love creating software we understand that sometimes it's just
          means to an end. In an age where everything tends to become digitized
          many meaningful product have to cross the "forest of software" to
          become something of value. We are here to make this path as easy as it
          gets for you.
